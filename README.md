# data-wrangling-proj

This repository has been created to store the code for my data wrangling project within my Springboard class. 

It includes:
a) a tidy version of the train and test data
b) the extraction of columns containing only the mean and standard deviation measurements, and
c) an independent data set containing the averages for each subject, activity, and variable
